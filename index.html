			<p>Over the years, the overlanding community has been getting bigger and bigger around the world. The Covid-19 pandemic boosted its growth as people wanted to explore more of the world around them. This guide will immerse you to the life of overlanding!<br><br>
			<span>Thrill amidst the peace</span><br>
			Overlanding is the combination of camping and offroading. The ultimate goal is to reach a destination in the wild that is inaccessible and remote. It is a great way to connect with nature and to test your survival skills. People have different reasons for going. Some go for the peace and serenity. Some go for the thrill and adventure. Personally, I am a combination of all.<br><br>
			<span>Irreplaceable essence</span><br>
			Overlanding is diverse in many ways. Each country, each location, and each trail has its own unique essence. The type of vehicle and gear is special to its owner. Above this, the connections you make with yourself and your companions in the journey is truly irreplaceable. 
			<br><br>
			<span>The community</span><br>
			Last but not the least is the sense of community. Whether you are alone or with a group, there is always a chance of running into another overlander in the wilderness. It is an unwritten rule that no one gets left behind no matter how harsh the situation is. Besides this, there is also a huge online presence where people love to share videos, car builds, and other experiences. It brings people together even those at home.
